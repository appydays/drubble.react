<h1>ScramAir Terms of Service</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 23, 2025</p>

<p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the ScramAir game (the "App") operated by DPDigital ("us", "we", or "our").</p>

<p>Your access to and use of the App is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the App.</p>

<p>By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the App.</p>

<h2>1. The App</h2>
<p>ScramAir is a free game developed and provided by DPDigital. The App is provided "as is" and is intended for entertainment purposes.</p>

<h2>2. Accounts</h2>
<p>When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our App.</p>
<p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the App and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our App or a third-party service (e.g., Google Sign-On).</p>
<p>You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

<h2>3. User Conduct</h2>
<p>You agree to use the App only for lawful purposes and in a way that does not infringe the rights of, restrict or inhibit anyone else's use and enjoyment of the App. Prohibited behaviour includes harassing or causing distress or inconvenience to any other user, transmitting obscene or offensive content, or disrupting the normal flow of dialogue within the App.</p>
<p>You specifically agree not to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the App, other accounts, computer systems, or networks connected to the App.</li>
    <li>Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the App or data contained therein.</li>
    <li>Use the App for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
    <li>Engage in any form of cheating, exploitation, or abuse of game mechanics that would provide an unfair advantage over other players.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>The App and its original content (excluding content provided by users), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of DPDigital. The App is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United Kingdom and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of DPDigital.</p>

<h2>5. Termination</h2>
<p>We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>
<p>Upon termination, your right to use the App will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may do so through the account settings within the App, or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@scramair.cymru">support@scramair.cymru</a>. All associated data will be deleted or anonymized upon termination, subject to our Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
<p>Your use of the App is at your sole risk. The App is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. The App is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or course of performance.</p>
<p>DPDigital does not warrant that a) the App will function uninterrupted, secure, or available at any particular time or location; b) any errors or defects will be corrected; c) the App is free of viruses or other harmful components; or d) the results of using the App will meet your requirements.</p>

<h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>In no event shall DPDigital, nor its developer, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the App; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the App; (iii) any content obtained from the App; and (iv) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>

<h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of <strong>England and Wales</strong>, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
<p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our App, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the App.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
<p>By continuing to access or use our App after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the App.</p>
