</ul>

<h2>4. How We Share Your Information</h2>
<p>We do not share your personal data with third parties for their marketing or commercial purposes. We only share your information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our App (e.g., hosting providers, email service providers for account-related emails). These third parties have access to your personal data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</li>
    <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency).</li>
    <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If DPDigital is involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your personal data may be transferred. We will provide notice before your personal data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>When your account is deleted, or you request deletion of your data, we will securely delete or anonymize your personal data within a reasonable timeframe, unless retention is required for legal or regulatory reasons.</p>

<h2>6. Your Data Protection Rights (UK GDPR)</h2>
<p>As a data subject under UK GDPR, you have the following rights concerning your personal data:</p>

<h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>As we are based in the UK and your app can be used globally, your data may be processed outside the UK. When transferring data outside the UK, we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses, adequacy decisions) to protect your personal data in accordance with UK data protection laws.</p>

<h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>While ScramAir has no specific age restrictions, it is primarily targeted at users aged 13 and above. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you learn that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@scramair.cymru">support@scramair.cymru</a>. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. We will also inform you via email or a prominent notice within the App prior to the change becoming effective. Your continued use of the App after the effective date of the revised Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the terms.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, your rights, or our data practices, please contact us by email at:</p>
